  ""Graph Explanation"": ""The graph titled 'BB turn report' shows a color-coded bar chart with different poker hands represented by numbers and letters across the bottom: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K, A. The bars are divided into two colors - red and green. The green segments represent positive actions or outcomes, while the red segments represent negative ones. Each column corresponds to a specific card or pair in a potential poker hand combination, and the height of each section suggests the frequency or intensity of the action it represents. The graph visually communicates the strategy or outcome likelihood of various poker hands in the context labeled 'DONKING MONOTONE TURNS'.""

    ""graph"": ""The graph shows a heads-up single raised pot between the Small Blind (SB) in position and the Big Blind (BB). During the flop, the board is A♠ 9♥ 2♦, with actions involving various betting amounts. The BB opts to check, and SB places a bet of 1 (25%). BB can then choose to call or raise with different fractions indicated, such as raise 1.3 (32%) followed by subsequent actions. The turn card is J♠ with options for check, bet 1.2 (20%), bet 2.4 (50%), bet 3.2 (76%), or all-in for BB. The SB options post-turn rely on BB's actions, including raising and going all-in. The river card is 6♣, where BB checks with a range of betting options including bet 1 (17%), bet 2.5 (42%), bet 4 (67%), bet 5.5 (92%), and bet 9 (150%). The steps depict typical post-flop actions and decision points within this scenario, emphasizing potential betting strategies and action frequencies based on the board texture.""
